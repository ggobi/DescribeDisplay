Here is what I meant in my last e-mail when I wrote about a  
"cleaner" version of writeGGobiXML... The main drawback the one you  
saw had is that is was tailored for the kind of objects I work with  
and not for "general" data frames or matrices. I've changed that in  
the attached version (within file GGobiAndR.R). I attach also the  
vignette (GGobiAndR.Rnw) and the manual/tutorial (obtained with  
Sweave("GGobiAndR.Rnw")). If you want to run the vignette on your  
onw machine you just need to change line 77 so that the path of  
ggobi/data folder on your machine appears on the command line.

You are (of course) free to modify and distribute this stuff as you  
want.

cheers,

Christophe.
